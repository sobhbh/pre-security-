# Day 6: Network Setup & Packet Analysis

## Objective
To assign static IP addresses to all lab VMs, confirm full network connectivity, and use Wireshark to capture and analyze fundamental network traffic (ICMP & ARP).

## Tools Used
- VirtualBox Network Settings
- Windows & Linux Network Configuration Tools
- `ping`
- Wireshark

## Steps & Evidence
I configured static IP addresses for my Windows Server and Kali Linux VMs within the same subnet. I then used the `ping` command to verify L3 connectivity between them.

Once connectivity was established, I launched Wireshark on the Kali machine and captured the traffic generated by a `ping` to the Windows Server. I analyzed the capture to identify the **ARP request/reply** (for MAC address resolution) followed by the **ICMP echo request/reply** packets.

## Challenges & Reflection
This lab made theoretical concepts like the OSI model tangible. Seeing the ARP and ICMP handshake in real-time demystified how devices on a local network communicate. Itâ€™s a foundational skill for any network troubleshooting.
