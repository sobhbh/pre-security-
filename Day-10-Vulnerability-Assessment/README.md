# Day 10: Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus

## Objective
To take the first official step from a defensive (Blue Team) role into an offensive security (Red Team) mindset. The goal was to install, configure, and run Nessus—the industry-standard vulnerability scanner—against the lab network I built to identify its weaknesses and understand the initial stages of a security assessment.

## Tools Used
-   Nessus Essentials
-   Kali Linux VM
-   pfSense Firewall VM
-   Windows Server 2019 VM

## Steps & Evidence

1.  **Nessus Installation:** After facing challenges with the registration process for Nessus Essentials (which requires a business email), I successfully registered using a free professional email provider (`proton.me`). I downloaded the `.deb` package for Debian/Kali and installed it via the command line using `dpkg`.

2.  **Service Configuration:** I started the Nessus service (`nessusd.service`) and completed the web-based setup at `https://localhost:8834`. This involved providing my activation code and waiting for the lengthy but crucial process of downloading and compiling the vulnerability plugins to complete. During this phase, I also configured my Kali VM's power and screensaver settings to prevent it from sleeping during long-running tasks.

3.  **Unauthenticated Network Scan:** I configured a "Basic Network Scan" in Nessus to perform an **unauthenticated scan** of my entire lab network. I defined the target as `192.168.56.0/24`, which instructed Nessus to discover and probe all potential hosts on that subnet.

4.  **Results Analysis (The "A-ha!" Moment):** The scan completed in approximately 20 minutes and revealed a significant number of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Kali VM (`192.168.56.20`):** Revealed multiple **High** and **Medium** severity vulnerabilities, demonstrating that even a security-focused OS running standard services like Apache is not secure by default.
    *   **pfSense VM (`192.168.56.1`):** Also had several **Medium** findings, highlighting that even dedicated security appliances require hardening.
    *   **Windows Server VM (`192.168.56.10`):** Was conspicuously absent from the high-severity results. This was a critical lesson in itself, proving that the default Windows Defender Firewall was effective at blocking the unauthenticated scan probes, thereby hiding potential vulnerabilities from the scanner.

## Challenges & Reflection

This day was a profound perspective shift. For nine days, I worked as a Blue Teamer, focused on building a functional network. In under 30 minutes, Nessus demonstrated that "functional" is not the same as "secure." Seeing a long list of vulnerabilities on the very systems I had so carefully built was a powerful and humbling experience.

-   **The Value of Scanners:** The efficiency of Nessus is astounding. It automates what would take a human analyst days or weeks to discover manually. It forces a "trust but verify" mindset and proves the necessity of active, ongoing security assessments.
-   **Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans:** The scan's inability to find major issues on the Windows Server perfectly illustrated the limitations of an unauthenticated scan. It could only see what an external attacker with no credentials could see. This highlights why *authenticated* scans (where Nessus is given login credentials) are a critical part of a true internal security audit, as they can see misconfigurations from the inside.
-   **Mindset Shift:** My focus is no longer just "Does it work?". It is now "How can this be broken?". This is the foundational mindset of a cybersecurity professional.

After the scan, I dedicated the rest of the day to the **GitHub Documentation Sprint**, going back through all my previous write-ups to edit, improve, and polish them, ensuring my portfolio accurately reflects the skills I've learned. Day 10 marks the successful completion of the infrastructure-building phase and the beginning of the security assessment phase of my training.
